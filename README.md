# Space-Wars
	We have worked hard over a few months of code club to bring to you a work-in-progress
	stratey game. We hope we will have lots of fun with this
A fast little straty game to play in your spare time!
		Stuff still to add:
#### Leon: Battlefield effect code
#### Leo: Battlefield effects images. You need to make a black hole, shockwave, and emp effect particle. TIP: use paint.net's effects
#### Aleks: SOUNDS!!!! WE NEED SOUNDS!!!!
#### Nour: Statistics, and final build
The stratiest (stratagy misspelled) game of all time.

# You can import on a school laptop, it is a pain to do though Nour did do it (miraculously)
